# covid_19_India_Analysis

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals. COVID-19 is the illness caused due to deadly SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus disease emerged in 2019 and was first identified in Wuhan, China. Coronavirus still remains a serious health risk. You should stay safe and take all necessary precautions to help protect yourself and others.

In this covid-19 data analysis project using Python and Tableau I have performed exploratory data analysis using Python and built covid-19 dashboard in Tableau. You will get an idea about the impact of Covid-19 in India and the how we indians have fought with this deadly virus by showing immense courage which could be easily explained by our recovery rates . Using Tableau, I have created plots about the  toatal cases, deaths, and recoveries. This interactive dashboard is very easy to understand.
